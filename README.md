To keep track of the tasks involved in this project we're going to use a kanban board. Ensure that you work on one _ticket_ at time. You can click on the ticket to find out more information about what is required for the feature. A ticket is not considered complete unless both the happy path and errors response are handled. You can make use of the checklist on each ticket to keep track of the errors you want to handle. You can also make use of [error-handling.md](error-handling.md) to consider the error codes we may wish to respond with.
